Notes for the GM
On Gold Cost:
Costs make sense for my campaigns, which are generally high-powered, 25pt builds with max-hp. So these consumables & the buffs they provide might need a heavy nerf if you're running a tighter campaign!

On Time Cost:
Here's where the party really pays for these incredible (usually very long lasting) buffs: Prep time. They need a kitchen of some sort. They need all the ingredients, a sufficient skill-check, and then they need time to eat them. None of these are intended to be eaten in a round (6 second cheeseburger contest, anyone?). They pay the minute (I usually demand 10m dinner time for these foods) to get the buff.

On taking fragile foods on adventures:
I do let them travel with the soups & such. We don't fuss over expiration or transportation. If magic can animate a corpse or teleport people across the world, it can make a cheap/quick little wooden tupperware container preserve a pint of organic matter for weeks/months. That's what I tell myselfâ€¦

Note from the Author:
My players are a rather bloodthirsty lot. Even the most refined among them will gladly chop off a body part from a defeated monster or even vivisect the entire creature if it means they will gain alchemical components they can use or sell. Perhaps my fellow GMs can relate?

So this collection of foods, ingredients, people, places, and tools grew and grew until it was at least a sub-plot-line within all my tables.

Thanks to the new version of FoundryVTT, it's easier than ever to package compendiums into a coherent & shareable mod, so here we are!

My advice if you desire it: Change anything and everything. Prices, rarity, qualities, requirements. Take the art and run with it. I hope any tiny piece of this is useful to you. I have constantly benefited from the generousity of the FVTT Mod community as well as the respective game-system communities (PF1 in particular has taught me a lot).

Bug me for anything.
